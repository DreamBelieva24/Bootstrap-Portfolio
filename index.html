                <p> Greetings! Thank you for visiting my page. I am a math teacher turned 
                    developer. It's amazing how similar the two different career paths actually
                    are. I worked as a teacher for 9.5 years. I was a virtual teacher for 5 years. 
                    Basically, I just made a switch from "math code" to computer code and from 
                    students to clients. My experience with teacher collaboration has built very
                    strong communication skills and has made me a team player. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As for my personality, I have never seemed to fit in one "box." I am 
                    analytical but creative. I work well independently but also enjoy working 
                    as a team. I have always been logical and math minded and mix
                    it up by being empathetic and understanding as well. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ultimately, I believe that time is a precious thing which causes me to be
                    very efficient and focus on building and keeping relationships. You should
                    enjoy what you spend your time on!
